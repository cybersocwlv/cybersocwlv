Welcome. This post will breifly explain what we're all about, why the society exists and why you should get involved.

### Our Aims

1. To create a community for the discussion of cuber security related topics, to increase understand and knowledge of the subject.
2. To provide the oppurtunity for students to network and build career links.
3. To advocate cyber security within the university and provide oppurtunities for students studying any element of cyber security.


### Our Objectives

1. To host events and meetings to provide a forum for discussion of cyber security.
2. To organise trops to pleacs of interet, including conferences, careers fairs and similar events.
3. Advocate student issues and lobby were appropriate.


### Membership

Membership is open to students only, this is required by Wolverhampton Student Union.

However, Associate Members and Alumni Members can join the society who are not students of the University of Wolverhampton.


### Our Plans

Meetings and events will be at convenient times when students are already in University, unless a particularly special event is organised.

- We plan to get external speakers, internal speakers and provide the oppurtunity for students to present to students - sharing knowledge you might have (we all have different backgrounds). The aim of these presentations is to give members a broader knowledge base and enhance highly valuable technical skills.

- Capture the Flag & Hackathons. We plan to facilitate Wolverhampton Cyber Research Centres interest in organising a CTF. We can organise similar, smaller events internally to obtain and practice specific skills.

- Attend local and national events. We can subsidise the cost of travel and travel together to conferences and other events.

Please share any ideas you have as well!

We are an open and interested society.

Thanks for reading. Hope to see you at our meetings! (see the events section on the main page for timetables)
